# Changelog

All notable changes to SIPhon are documented here. The format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning is lockstep across
the `siphon-sip` crate and the `siphon-sip` Python SDK, driven by the git tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Internal
- Criterion microbenchmarks for the per-message SIP hot paths
  (`benches/sip_hot_path.rs`): parse, serialize, roundtrip, header access/mutate,
  and transaction-key extraction. They isolate the individual costs the SIPp
  throughput baseline averages over.
- Release-cut regression gate (`scripts/bench_regression.sh`, wired into
  `scripts/cut-release.sh`): fails on >10% slowdown vs the committed
  `benches/baseline.json`. Self-contained (reads criterion's own `estimates.json`,
  no `critcmp`/`jq`). CI proves the benches compile; the hard timing gate runs at
  release cut on fixed hardware, where absolute timings are meaningful.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-26

First stable release. A love letter to Kamailio and OpenSIPS — their proven
architecture, rebuilt with a Rust core and free-threaded Python 3.14t scripting.
The developer writes business logic; SIPhon owns the protocol.

### Core
- RFC 3261 SIP parser (RFC 4475 torture tests, proptest roundtrips, fuzzing)
- Stateful proxy (§16) with parallel/sequential forking (§16.7)
- Transaction state machines (§17), dialog tracking, Record-Route / loose routing
- First-class, scriptable B2BUA (§6) — proxy and B2BUA in a single binary

### Transports
- UDP, TCP, TLS 1.3, WebSocket (WS/WSS), SCTP
- NAT traversal (rport, RFC 3581), Outbound / flow tokens (RFC 5626)

### Registrar & auth
- AoR store with memory / Redis / PostgreSQL backends, GRUU, Service-Route
- Digest auth (RFC 2617 / 7616) with timestamp-bound nonces and AoR-to-user binding
- AKAv1-MD5 / Milenage (RFC 3310, 3GPP TS 33.203 / 35.206)

### IMS & 5G
- Diameter Cx / Rx / Ro / Rf / Sh; Initial Filter Criteria (iFC) with ISC routing
- IPsec SA management for P-CSCF; 5G SBI Npcf (N5) + Nbsf PCF discovery
- Runnable P-CSCF / I-CSCF / S-CSCF examples

### Media & routing
- RTPEngine NG media anchoring, SDP codec filtering, media injection
- Gateway load balancing with health probing, DNS SRV/NAPTR (RFC 3263), ENUM
- Presence (SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY, PIDF, RLS), outbound REGISTER

### Observability & compliance
- Prometheus metrics (built-in + custom), HEP/Homer tracing, CDR, admin HTTP API
- Lawful Intercept (ETSI X1/X2/X3) + SIPREC (RFC 7865 / 7866), graceful shutdown

### Scripting
- Free-threaded Python 3.14t (no GIL), hot-reload, sync + async handlers
- `siphon-sip` mock SDK on PyPI for unit-testing scripts (imported as `siphon_sdk`)

### Performance
- Design targets — Proxy 10k cps, B2BUA 5k cps (8-core). Stays clean past
  31.9k cps on the reference box with zero failures and zero retransmits across
  all 16 baseline rows.
